# Sudoku Solver
## Leetcode Question 37

One of my uni C++ assignments is to solve sudoku-like boards.  
I wrote this sudoku solver for leetcode Q37 with that prior experience.  
Some optimisations are done, just like my implementation in the assignment.  

Note: Just for fun! Don't take it seriously.
